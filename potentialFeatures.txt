Time holding ball before shot
defenders within x distance
how much defender is obscuring shot
distance from hoop
See if I can build model to identify cross court pass

Defender and shooter velocity/acceleration prior to shot
Shooting zone (corner/top/wings)
Offensive spacing(possibly indicating kickout)
Identifying specific shooting scenarios (behind screen, set shooter, kickout...)
Man vs zone Defense?
